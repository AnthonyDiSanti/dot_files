# /context/user_shared

This folder holds collaborative documents between the user and agent that should live **outside** the repo’s source code.
Use it for drafts, specs, research notes, and working documents — including early code or prototypes that are not yet ready to merge.

## Guidelines
- Prefer Markdown with clear, descriptive filenames (use subfolders for larger drafts or code prototypes).
- Keep documents concise and easy to scan.
- Do not store secrets or credentials.
- Use `/context/knowledge/` for distilled repo insights and `/context/reference/` for third-party docs.
