# macOS keybindings

- Source: `settings/OSXKeyBindings.dict`
- Why it matters: custom Home/End/PageUp/PageDown behavior in Cocoa text fields.
- When to consult: adjusting keybindings or troubleshooting text navigation.
- Key points: copy to `~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict` to apply.
- Gotchas: changes require app restart to take effect.
