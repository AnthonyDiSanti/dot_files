# Knowledge Base

Curated notes that reduce repeated setup or debugging for this dotfiles repo. Keep this index short and link to deeper topic files.

## How to use
- Add a topic file when a note grows beyond ~20 lines or needs structure.
- Keep each topic focused and link to it from this index.
- Put third-party documentation in `/context/reference/` and link from the relevant topic.

## Notes
- Keep short, cross-cutting notes here; promote them to a topic file once they grow.
