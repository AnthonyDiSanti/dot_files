# Building with extended thinking

<Note>
This feature is eligible for [Zero Data Retention (ZDR)](/docs/en/build-with-claude/api-and-data-retention). When your organization has a ZDR arrangement, data sent through this feature is not stored after the API response is returned.
</Note>

Extended thinking gives Claude enhanced reasoning capabilities for complex tasks, while providing varying levels of transparency into its step-by-step thought process before it delivers its final answer.

<Note>
For Claude Opus 4.7 and later models, use [adaptive thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/adaptive-thinking) (`thinking: {type: "adaptive"}`) with the [effort parameter](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort). Manual extended thinking (`thinking: {type: "enabled", budget_tokens: N}`) is no longer supported on Claude Opus 4.7 or later models and returns a 400 error. For Claude Opus 4.6 and Claude Sonnet 4.6, adaptive thinking is also recommended; the manual configuration is still functional on these models but is deprecated and will be removed in a future model release.
</Note>

## Supported models

Manual extended thinking (`thinking: {type: "enabled", budget_tokens: N}`) is supported on all current Claude models **except Claude Opus 4.7 and later models**, where it is no longer accepted and returns a 400 error. A few models have mode-specific behavior:

- **Claude Opus 4.7 (`claude-opus-4-7`) and later models:** manual extended thinking is no longer supported. Use [adaptive thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/adaptive-thinking) (`thinking: {type: "adaptive"}`) with the [effort parameter](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) instead.
- **[Claude Mythos Preview](https://anthropic.com/glasswing):** [adaptive thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/adaptive-thinking) is the default; `thinking: {type: "enabled", budget_tokens: N}` is also accepted. `thinking: {type: "disabled"}` is not supported, and `display` defaults to `"omitted"` rather than returning thinking content. Pass `display: "summarized"` to receive summaries.
- **Claude Opus 4.6 (`claude-opus-4-6`):** [adaptive thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/adaptive-thinking) recommended; manual mode (`type: "enabled"`) is deprecated but still functional.
- **Claude Sonnet 4.6 (`claude-sonnet-4-6`):** [adaptive thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/adaptive-thinking) recommended; manual mode (`type: "enabled"`) with [interleaved mode](#interleaved-thinking) is deprecated but still functional.

<Note>
API behavior differs across Claude Sonnet 3.7 and Claude 4 models, but the API shapes remain exactly the same.

For more information, see [Differences in thinking across model versions](#differences-in-thinking-across-model-versions).
</Note>

## How extended thinking works

When extended thinking is turned on, Claude creates `thinking` content blocks where it outputs its internal reasoning. Claude incorporates insights from this reasoning before crafting a final response.

The API response includes `thinking` content blocks, followed by `text` content blocks.

Here's an example of the default response format:

```json
{
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "thinking",
      "thinking": "Let me analyze this step by step...",
      "signature": "WaUjzkypQ2mUEVM36O2TxuC06KN8xyfbJwyem2dw3URve/op91XWHOEBLLqIOMfFG/UvLEczmEsUjavL...."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "Based on my analysis..."
    }
  ]
}
```

For more information about the response format of extended thinking, see the [Messages API Reference](/docs/en/api/messages/create).

</CodeGroup>

To turn on extended thinking, add a `thinking` object, with the `type` parameter set to `enabled` and the `budget_tokens` to a specified token budget for extended thinking. For Claude Opus 4.6 and Claude Sonnet 4.6, use `type: "adaptive"` instead. See [Adaptive thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/adaptive-thinking) for details. While `type: "enabled"` with `budget_tokens` is still functional on these models, it is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

The `budget_tokens` parameter determines the maximum number of tokens Claude is allowed to use for its internal reasoning process. In Claude 4 and later models, this limit applies to full thinking tokens, and not to [the summarized output](#summarized-thinking). Larger budgets can improve response quality by enabling more thorough analysis for complex problems, although Claude may not use the entire budget allocated, especially at ranges above 32k.

<Warning>
`budget_tokens` is [deprecated](/docs/en/build-with-claude/overview#feature-availability) on Claude Opus 4.6 and Claude Sonnet 4.6 and will be removed in a future model release. Use [adaptive thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/adaptive-thinking) with the [effort parameter](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) to control thinking depth instead.
</Warning>

<Note>
[Claude Mythos Preview](https://anthropic.com/glasswing), Claude Opus 4.7, and Claude Opus 4.6 support up to 128k output tokens. Claude Sonnet 4.6 and Claude Haiku 4.5 support up to 64k. See the [models overview](/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview) for limits on legacy models. On the [Message Batches API](/docs/en/build-with-claude/batch-processing#extended-output-beta), the `output-300k-2026-03-24` [beta header](/docs/en/api/beta-headers) raises the output limit to 300k for Opus 4.7, Opus 4.6, and Sonnet 4.6.
</Note>

`budget_tokens` must be set to a value less than `max_tokens`. However, when using [interleaved thinking with tools](#interleaved-thinking), you can exceed this limit as the token limit becomes your entire context window. Because `budget_tokens` must be less than `max_tokens`, extended thinking cannot be combined with `max_tokens: 0` ([cache pre-warming](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching#pre-warming-the-cache)).

### Summarized thinking

With extended thinking enabled, the Messages API for Claude 4 models returns a summary of Claude's full thinking process. Summarized thinking provides the full intelligence benefits of extended thinking, while preventing misuse. This is the default behavior on Claude 4 models when the `display` field on the thinking configuration is unset or set to `"summarized"`. On Claude Opus 4.7 and [Claude Mythos Preview](https://anthropic.com/glasswing), `display` defaults to `"omitted"` instead, so you must set `display: "summarized"` explicitly to receive summarized thinking.

Here are some important considerations for summarized thinking:

- You're charged for the full thinking tokens generated by the original request, not the summary tokens.
- The billed output token count will **not match** the count of tokens you see in the response.
- On Claude 4 models, the first few lines of thinking output are more verbose, providing detailed reasoning that's particularly helpful for prompt engineering purposes. [Claude Mythos Preview](https://anthropic.com/glasswing) summarizes from the first token, so its thinking blocks do not show this verbose preamble.
- As Anthropic seeks to improve the extended thinking feature, summarization behavior is subject to change.
- Summarization preserves the key ideas of Claude's thinking process with minimal added latency, enabling a streamable user experience and easy migration from Claude Sonnet 3.7 to Claude 4 and later models.
- Summarization is processed by a different model than the one you target in your requests. The thinking model does not see the summarized output.

<Note>
Claude Sonnet 3.7 continues to return full thinking output.

In rare cases where you need access to full thinking output for Claude 4 models, [contact our sales team](mailto:sales@anthropic.com).
</Note>

### Controlling thinking display

The `display` field on the thinking configuration controls how thinking content is returned in API responses. It accepts two values:

- `"summarized"`: Thinking blocks contain summarized thinking text. See [Summarized thinking](#summarized-thinking) for details. This is the default on Claude Opus 4.6, Claude Sonnet 4.6, and earlier Claude 4 models.
- `"omitted"`: Thinking blocks are returned with an empty `thinking` field. The `signature` field still carries the encrypted full thinking for multi-turn continuity (see [Thinking encryption](#thinking-encryption)). This is the default on Claude Opus 4.7 and [Claude Mythos Preview](https://anthropic.com/glasswing).

Setting `display: "omitted"` is useful when your application doesn't surface thinking content to users. The primary benefit is **faster time-to-first-text-token when streaming:** The server skips streaming thinking tokens entirely and delivers only the signature, so the final text response begins streaming sooner.

Here are some important considerations for omitted thinking:

- You're still charged for the full thinking tokens. Omitting reduces latency, not cost.
- If you pass thinking blocks back in multi-turn conversations, pass them unchanged. The server decrypts the `signature` to reconstruct the original thinking for prompt construction (see [Preserving thinking blocks](/docs/en/build-with-claude/extended-thinking#preserving-thinking-blocks)). Any text you place in the `thinking` field of a round-tripped omitted block is ignored.
- `display` is invalid with `thinking.type: "disabled"` (there is nothing to display).
- When using `thinking.type: "adaptive"` and the model skips thinking for a simple request, no thinking block is produced regardless of `display`.

<Note>
The `signature` field is identical whether `display` is `"summarized"` or `"omitted"`. Switching `display` values between turns in a conversation is supported.
</Note>

<Note>
On [Claude Mythos Preview](https://anthropic.com/glasswing), `display` defaults to `"omitted"`. The examples in this section pass `display` explicitly so they apply to all models, but on Mythos Preview you can leave it unset and receive the same behavior. To receive summarized thinking on Mythos Preview, set `display: "summarized"` explicitly.
</Note>

Automated pipelines that never surface thinking content to end users can skip the overhead of receiving thinking tokens over the wire. Latency-sensitive applications get the same reasoning quality without waiting for thinking text to stream before the final response begins.

        $block instanceof TextBlock => "Response: {$block->text}\n",
        default => '',
    };
}
```

```ruby Ruby hidelines={1..2}
require "anthropic"

client = Anthropic::Client.new

response = client.messages.create(
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-6",
  max_tokens: 16000,
  thinking: {
    type: :enabled,
    budget_tokens: 10000,
    # The Ruby SDK uses `display_` (trailing underscore) to avoid
    # shadowing Kernel#display; the wire field is still `display`.
    display_: :omitted
  },
  messages: [{role: "user", content: "What is 27 * 453?"}]
)

response.content.each do |block|
  case block.type
  when :thinking
    puts block.thinking.empty? ? "Thinking: [omitted]" : "Thinking: #{block.thinking}"
  when :text
    puts "Response: #{block.text}"
  end
end
```
</CodeGroup>

When `display: "omitted"` is set, the response contains `thinking` blocks with an empty `thinking` field:

```json Output
{
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "thinking",
      "thinking": "",
      "signature": "EosnCkYICxIMMb3LzNrMu..."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "The answer is 12,231."
    }
  ]
}
```

When streaming with `display: "omitted"`, no `thinking_delta` events are emitted; see [Streaming thinking](#streaming-thinking) below for the event sequence.

### Streaming thinking

You can stream extended thinking responses using [server-sent events (SSE)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Web/API/Server-sent%5Fevents/Using%5Fserver-sent%5Fevents).

When streaming is enabled for extended thinking, you receive thinking content via `thinking_delta` events.

When `display: "omitted"` is set, no `thinking_delta` events are emitted. See [Controlling thinking display](#controlling-thinking-display).

For more documentation on streaming via the Messages API, see [Streaming Messages](/docs/en/build-with-claude/streaming).

Here's how to handle streaming with thinking:

When `display: "omitted"` is set, the thinking block opens, a single `signature_delta` arrives, and the block closes without any `thinking_delta` events. Text streaming begins immediately after:

```sse Output
event: content_block_start
data: {"type":"content_block_start","index":0,"content_block":{"type":"thinking","thinking":"","signature":""}}

event: content_block_delta
data: {"type":"content_block_delta","index":0,"delta":{"type":"signature_delta","signature":"EosnCkYICxIMMb3LzNrMu..."}}

event: content_block_stop
data: {"type":"content_block_stop","index":0}

event: content_block_start
data: {"type":"content_block_start","index":1,"content_block":{"type":"text","text":""}}
```

<Note>
When using streaming with thinking enabled, you might notice that text sometimes arrives in larger chunks alternating with smaller, token-by-token delivery. This is expected behavior, especially for thinking content.

The streaming system needs to process content in batches for optimal performance, which can result in this "chunky" delivery pattern, with possible delays between streaming events. Anthropic is continuously working to improve this experience, with future updates focused on making thinking content stream more smoothly.
</Note>

## Extended thinking with tool use

Extended thinking can be used alongside [tool use](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview), allowing Claude to reason through tool selection and results processing.

When using extended thinking with tool use, be aware of the following limitations:

1. **Tool choice limitation**: Tool use with thinking only supports `tool_choice: {"type": "auto"}` (the default) or `tool_choice: {"type": "none"}`. Using `tool_choice: {"type": "any"}` or `tool_choice: {"type": "tool", "name": "..."}` will result in an error because these options force tool use, which is incompatible with extended thinking.

2. **Preserving thinking blocks**: During tool use, you must pass `thinking` blocks back to the API for the last assistant message. Include the complete unmodified block back to the API to maintain reasoning continuity.

### Toggling thinking modes in conversations

You can't toggle thinking in the middle of an assistant turn, including during tool use loops. The entire assistant turn should operate in a single thinking mode:

- **If thinking is enabled**, the final assistant turn should start with a thinking block.
- **If thinking is disabled**, the final assistant turn shouldn't contain any thinking blocks

From the model's perspective, **tool use loops are part of the assistant turn**. An assistant turn doesn't complete until Claude finishes its full response, which may include multiple tool calls and results.

For example, this sequence is all part of a **single assistant turn**:
```text
User: "What's the weather in Paris?"
Assistant: [thinking] + [tool_use: get_weather]
User: [tool_result: "20°C, sunny"]
Assistant: [text: "The weather in Paris is 20°C and sunny"]
```

Even though there are multiple API messages, the tool use loop is conceptually part of one continuous assistant response.

#### Graceful thinking degradation

When a mid-turn thinking conflict occurs (such as toggling thinking on or off during a tool use loop), the API automatically disables thinking for that request. To preserve model quality and remain on-distribution, the API may:

- Strip thinking blocks from the conversation when they would create an invalid turn structure
- Disable thinking for the current request when the conversation history is incompatible with thinking being enabled

This means that attempting to toggle thinking mid-turn won't cause an error, but thinking will be silently disabled for that request. To confirm whether thinking was active, check for the presence of `thinking` blocks in the response.

#### Practical guidance

**Best practice**: Plan your thinking strategy at the start of each turn rather than trying to toggle mid-turn.

**Example: Toggling thinking after completing a turn**
```text
User: "What's the weather?"
Assistant: [tool_use] (thinking disabled)
User: [tool_result]
Assistant: [text: "It's sunny"]
User: "What about tomorrow?"
Assistant: [thinking] + [text: "..."] (thinking enabled - new turn)
```

By completing the assistant turn before toggling thinking, you ensure that thinking is actually enabled for the new request.

<Note>
Toggling thinking modes also invalidates prompt caching for message history. For more details, see the [Extended thinking with prompt caching](#extended-thinking-with-prompt-caching) section.

### Preserving thinking blocks

During tool use, you must pass `thinking` blocks back to the API, and you must include the complete unmodified block back to the API. This is critical for maintaining the model's reasoning flow and conversation integrity.

<Tip>
While you can omit `thinking` blocks from prior `assistant` role turns, always pass back all thinking blocks to the API for any multi-turn conversation. The API:
- Automatically filters the provided thinking blocks
- Uses the relevant thinking blocks necessary to preserve the model's reasoning
- Only bills for the input tokens for the blocks shown to Claude

Which blocks are kept depends on the model. See [Thinking block preservation by model](#thinking-block-preservation-in-claude-opus-45-and-later) for the per-class defaults. To override the default, use the [`clear_thinking_20251015` context-editing strategy](/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-editing#thinking-block-clearing).
</Tip>

<Note>
When toggling thinking modes during a conversation, remember that the entire assistant turn (including tool use loops) must operate in a single thinking mode. For more details, see [Toggling thinking modes in conversations](#toggling-thinking-modes-in-conversations).
</Note>

When Claude invokes tools, it is pausing its construction of a response to await external information. When tool results are returned, Claude continues building that existing response. This necessitates preserving thinking blocks during tool use, for a couple of reasons:

1. **Reasoning continuity**: The thinking blocks capture Claude's step-by-step reasoning that led to tool requests. When you post tool results, including the original thinking ensures Claude can continue its reasoning from where it left off.

2. **Context maintenance**: While tool results appear as user messages in the API structure, they're part of a continuous reasoning flow. Preserving thinking blocks maintains this conceptual flow across multiple API calls. For more information on context management, see the [guide on context windows](/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows).

**Important**: When providing `thinking` blocks, the entire sequence of consecutive `thinking` blocks must match the outputs generated by the model during the original request; you can't rearrange or modify the sequence of these blocks.

### Interleaved thinking

Extended thinking with tool use in Claude 4 models supports interleaved thinking, which enables Claude to think between tool calls and make more sophisticated reasoning after receiving tool results.

With interleaved thinking, Claude can:
- Reason about the results of a tool call before deciding what to do next
- Chain multiple tool calls with reasoning steps in between
- Make more nuanced decisions based on intermediate results

**Model support:**
- **[Claude Mythos Preview](https://anthropic.com/glasswing)**: Interleaved thinking happens automatically. Every inter-tool reasoning step moves into a thinking block instead of plain text, and thinking blocks are preserved across turns by default. No beta header is needed or supported.
- **Claude Opus 4.7**: Interleaved thinking is automatically enabled when using [adaptive thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/adaptive-thinking) (the only supported thinking mode on Opus 4.7). No beta header is needed.
- **Claude Opus 4.6**: Interleaved thinking is automatically enabled when using [adaptive thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/adaptive-thinking). No beta header is needed. The `interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14` beta header is **deprecated** on Opus 4.6 and is safely ignored if included.
- **Claude Sonnet 4.6**: Interleaved thinking is automatically enabled when using [adaptive thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/adaptive-thinking) (recommended). The `interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14` beta header with manual extended thinking (`thinking: {type: "enabled"}`) is still functional but deprecated.
- **Other Claude 4 models** (Opus 4.5, Opus 4.1, Opus 4 (deprecated), Sonnet 4.5, Sonnet 4 (deprecated)): Add [the beta header](/docs/en/api/beta-headers) `interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14` to your API request to enable interleaved thinking.

Here are some important considerations for interleaved thinking:
- With interleaved thinking, the `budget_tokens` can exceed the `max_tokens` parameter, as it represents the total budget across all thinking blocks within one assistant turn.
- Interleaved thinking is only supported for [tools used via the Messages API](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview).
- Direct calls to the Claude API allow you to pass `interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14` in requests to any model, with no effect (except Opus 4.7 and Opus 4.6, where it's deprecated and safely ignored).
- On 3rd-party platforms (for example, [Amazon Bedrock](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-in-amazon-bedrock) and [Vertex AI](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-on-vertex-ai)), if you pass `interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14` to any model aside from Claude Opus 4.7, Claude Opus 4.6, Claude Sonnet 4.6, Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Opus 4.1, Opus 4 (deprecated), Sonnet 4.5, or Sonnet 4 (deprecated), your request will fail.

<section title="Tool use without interleaved thinking">

Without interleaved thinking, Claude thinks once at the start of the assistant turn. Subsequent responses after tool results continue without new thinking blocks.

```text
User: "What's the total revenue if we sold 150 units at $50 each,
       and how does this compare to our average monthly revenue?"

Turn 1: [thinking] "I need to calculate 150 * $50, then check the database..."
        [tool_use: calculator] { "expression": "150 * 50" }
  ↓ tool result: "7500"

Turn 2: [tool_use: database_query] { "query": "SELECT AVG(revenue)..." }
        ↑ no thinking block
  ↓ tool result: "5200"

Turn 3: [text] "The total revenue is $7,500, which is 44% above your
        average monthly revenue of $5,200."
        ↑ no thinking block
```

</section>

<section title="Tool use with interleaved thinking">

With interleaved thinking enabled, Claude can think after receiving each tool result, allowing it to reason about intermediate results before continuing.

```text
User: "What's the total revenue if we sold 150 units at $50 each,
       and how does this compare to our average monthly revenue?"

Turn 1: [thinking] "I need to calculate 150 * $50 first..."
        [tool_use: calculator] { "expression": "150 * 50" }
  ↓ tool result: "7500"

Turn 2: [thinking] "Got $7,500. Now I should query the database to compare..."
        [tool_use: database_query] { "query": "SELECT AVG(revenue)..." }
        ↑ thinking after receiving calculator result
  ↓ tool result: "5200"

Turn 3: [thinking] "$7,500 vs $5,200 average - that's a 44% increase..."
        [text] "The total revenue is $7,500, which is 44% above your
        average monthly revenue of $5,200."
        ↑ thinking before final answer
```

## Extended thinking with prompt caching

[Prompt caching](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) with thinking has several important considerations:

<Tip>
Extended thinking tasks often take longer than 5 minutes to complete. Consider using the [1-hour cache duration](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching#1-hour-cache-duration) to maintain cache hits across longer thinking sessions and multi-step workflows.
</Tip>

**Thinking block context removal**
- On earlier Opus/Sonnet models and all Haiku models, thinking blocks from previous turns are removed from context, which can affect cache breakpoints. On Opus 4.5+ and Sonnet 4.6+, they are kept by default.
- When continuing conversations with tool use, thinking blocks are cached and count as input tokens when read from cache
- This creates a tradeoff: while thinking blocks don't consume context window space visually, they still count toward your input token usage when cached
- If thinking becomes disabled and you pass thinking content in the current tool use turn, the thinking content will be stripped and thinking will remain disabled for that request

**Cache invalidation patterns**
- Changes to thinking parameters (enabled/disabled or budget allocation) invalidate message cache breakpoints
- [Interleaved thinking](#interleaved-thinking) amplifies cache invalidation, as thinking blocks can occur between multiple [tool calls](#extended-thinking-with-tool-use)
- System prompts and tools remain cached despite thinking parameter changes or block removal

<Note>
On earlier Opus/Sonnet models and all Haiku models, thinking blocks are removed for caching and context calculations; on Opus 4.5+ and Sonnet 4.6+, they are kept by default. In either case, they must be preserved when continuing conversations with [tool use](#extended-thinking-with-tool-use), especially with [interleaved thinking](#interleaved-thinking).
</Note>

### Understanding thinking block caching behavior

When using extended thinking with tool use, thinking blocks exhibit specific caching behavior that affects token counting:

**How it works:**

1. Caching only occurs when you make a subsequent request that includes tool results
2. When the subsequent request is made, the previous conversation history (including thinking blocks) can be cached
3. These cached thinking blocks count as input tokens in your usage metrics when read from the cache
4. When a non-tool-result user block is included: on Opus 4.5+ and Sonnet 4.6+, previous thinking blocks are kept; on earlier Opus/Sonnet models and all Haiku models, all previous thinking blocks are ignored and stripped from context

**Detailed example flow:**

**Request 1:**
```text
User: "What's the weather in Paris?"
```
**Response 1:**
```text
[thinking_block_1] + [tool_use block 1]
```

**Request 2:**
```text
User: ["What's the weather in Paris?"],
Assistant: [thinking_block_1] + [tool_use block 1],
User: [tool_result_1, cache=True]
```
**Response 2:**
```text
[thinking_block_2] + [text block 2]
```
Request 2 writes a cache of the request content (not the response). The cache includes the original user message, the first thinking block, tool use block, and the tool result.

**Request 3:**
```text
User: ["What's the weather in Paris?"],
Assistant: [thinking_block_1] + [tool_use block 1],
User: [tool_result_1, cache=True],
Assistant: [thinking_block_2] + [text block 2],
User: [Text response, cache=True]
```
For Opus 4.5+ and Sonnet 4.6+, all previous thinking blocks are kept by default. For earlier Opus/Sonnet models and all Haiku models, because a non-tool-result user block was included, all previous thinking blocks are ignored and stripped from context. This request will be processed the same as:
```text
User: ["What's the weather in Paris?"],
Assistant: [tool_use block 1],
User: [tool_result_1, cache=True],
Assistant: [text block 2],
User: [Text response, cache=True]
```

**Key points:**
- This caching behavior happens automatically, even without explicit `cache_control` markers
- This behavior is consistent whether using regular thinking or interleaved thinking

          type: "text",
          text: "Analyze the tone of this passage."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      role: "assistant",
      content: response1.content
    },
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "Analyze the characters in this passage."
    },
    {
      role: "assistant",
      content: response2.content
    },
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "Analyze the setting in this passage."
    }
  ]
)

puts "Third response usage: #{response3.usage}"
```

</CodeGroup>

Here is the output of the script (you may see slightly different numbers)

```text Output
First request - establishing cache
First response usage: { cache_creation_input_tokens: 1370, cache_read_input_tokens: 0, input_tokens: 17, output_tokens: 700 }

Second request - same thinking parameters (cache hit expected)

Second response usage: { cache_creation_input_tokens: 0, cache_read_input_tokens: 1370, input_tokens: 303, output_tokens: 874 }

Third request - different thinking budget (cache miss expected)
Third response usage: { cache_creation_input_tokens: 1370, cache_read_input_tokens: 0, input_tokens: 747, output_tokens: 619 }
```

This example demonstrates that when caching is set up in the messages array, changing the thinking parameters (budget_tokens increased from 4000 to 8000) **invalidates the cache**. The third request shows no cache hit with `cache_creation_input_tokens=1370` and `cache_read_input_tokens=0`, proving that message-based caching is invalidated when thinking parameters change.

## Max tokens and context window size with extended thinking

In older Claude models (prior to Claude Sonnet 3.7), if the sum of prompt tokens and `max_tokens` exceeded the model's context window, the system would automatically adjust `max_tokens` to fit within the context limit. This meant you could set a large `max_tokens` value and the system would silently reduce it as needed.

With Claude 3.7 and 4 models, `max_tokens` (which includes your thinking budget when thinking is enabled) is enforced as a strict limit. The system will now return a validation error if prompt tokens + `max_tokens` exceeds the context window size.

<Note>
You can read through the [guide on context windows](/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows) for a more thorough deep dive.
</Note>

### The context window with extended thinking

When calculating context window usage with thinking enabled, there are some considerations to be aware of:

- On Opus 4.5+ and Sonnet 4.6+, thinking blocks from previous turns are kept and count towards your context window; on earlier Opus/Sonnet models and all Haiku models, they are stripped and not counted
- Current turn thinking counts towards your `max_tokens` limit for that turn

The diagram below demonstrates the specialized token management when extended thinking is enabled:

![Context window diagram with extended thinking](/docs/images/context-window-thinking.svg)

The effective context window is calculated as:

```text
context window =
  (current input tokens - previous thinking tokens) +
  (thinking tokens + encrypted thinking tokens + text output tokens)
```

Use the [token counting API](/docs/en/build-with-claude/token-counting) to get accurate token counts for your specific use case, especially when working with multi-turn conversations that include thinking.

### The context window with extended thinking and tool use

When using extended thinking with tool use, thinking blocks must be explicitly preserved and returned with the tool results.

The effective context window calculation for extended thinking with tool use becomes:

```text
context window =
  (current input tokens + previous thinking tokens + tool use tokens) +
  (thinking tokens + encrypted thinking tokens + text output tokens)
```

The diagram below illustrates token management for extended thinking with tool use:

![Context window diagram with extended thinking and tool use](/docs/images/context-window-thinking-tools.svg)

### Managing tokens with extended thinking

Given the context window and `max_tokens` behavior with extended thinking Claude 3.7 and 4 models, you may need to:

- More actively monitor and manage your token usage
- Adjust `max_tokens` values as your prompt length changes
- Potentially use the [token counting endpoints](/docs/en/build-with-claude/token-counting) more frequently
- Be aware that previous thinking blocks don't accumulate in your context window

This change has been made to provide more predictable and transparent behavior, especially as maximum token limits have increased significantly.

## Thinking encryption

Full thinking content is encrypted and returned in the `signature` field. This field is used to verify that thinking blocks were generated by Claude when passed back to the API.

<Note>
It is only strictly necessary to send back thinking blocks when using [tools with extended thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/extended-thinking#extended-thinking-with-tool-use). Otherwise you can omit thinking blocks from previous turns. If you pass them back, whether the API keeps or strips them depends on the model: Opus 4.5+ and Sonnet 4.6+ keep them in context by default; earlier Opus/Sonnet models and all Haiku models strip them. See [context editing](/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-editing) to configure this.

If sending back thinking blocks, we recommend passing everything back as you received it for consistency and to avoid potential issues.
</Note>

Here are some important considerations on thinking encryption:
- When [streaming responses](/docs/en/build-with-claude/extended-thinking#streaming-thinking), the signature is added via a `signature_delta` inside a `content_block_delta` event just before the `content_block_stop` event.
- `signature` values are significantly longer in Claude 4 models than in previous models.
- The `signature` field is an opaque field and should not be interpreted or parsed.
- `signature` values are compatible across platforms (Claude APIs, [Amazon Bedrock](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-in-amazon-bedrock), and [Vertex AI](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-on-vertex-ai)). Values generated on one platform will be compatible with another.

## Redacted thinking blocks

In addition to regular `thinking` blocks, the API may return `redacted_thinking` blocks. A `redacted_thinking` block contains encrypted thinking content in a `data` field, with no readable summary:

```json
{
  "type": "redacted_thinking",
  "data": "..."
}
```

The `data` field is opaque and encrypted. Like the `signature` field on regular thinking blocks, you should pass `redacted_thinking` blocks back to the API unchanged when continuing a multi-turn conversation with [tools](/docs/en/build-with-claude/extended-thinking#extended-thinking-with-tool-use).

<Tip>
If your code filters content blocks by type (for example, `block.type == "thinking"`) when round-tripping responses with tool use, also include `redacted_thinking` blocks. Filtering on `block.type == "thinking"` alone silently drops `redacted_thinking` blocks and breaks the multi-turn protocol described above.
</Tip>

<Note>
`redacted_thinking` blocks are a distinct content block type returned by the API when portions of thinking are safety-redacted. This is separate from the [`display: "omitted"`](#controlling-thinking-display) option, which returns regular `thinking` blocks with an empty `thinking` field.
</Note>

## Differences in thinking across model versions

The Messages API handles thinking differently across Claude Sonnet 3.7 and Claude 4 models, primarily in summarization behavior.

See the table below for a condensed comparison:

| Feature | Claude Sonnet 3.7 | Claude 4 Models (pre-Opus 4.5) | Claude Opus 4.5 | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | Claude Opus 4.6 ([adaptive thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/adaptive-thinking)) | Claude Opus 4.7 ([adaptive thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/adaptive-thinking)) | [Claude Mythos Preview](https://anthropic.com/glasswing) ([adaptive thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/adaptive-thinking)) |
|---------|------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Thinking Output** | Returns full thinking output | Returns summarized thinking | Returns summarized thinking | Returns summarized thinking | Returns summarized thinking | Returns summarized thinking | Omitted by default; set `display: "summarized"` to receive summarized thinking. Raw thinking tokens are never returned. |
| **Interleaved Thinking** | Not supported | Supported with `interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14` beta header | Supported with `interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14` beta header | Supported with `interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14` beta header or automatic with [adaptive thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/adaptive-thinking) | Automatic with adaptive thinking (beta header not supported) | Automatic with adaptive thinking (beta header not supported) | Automatic with adaptive thinking (beta header not supported). Inter-tool reasoning moves into thinking blocks on this model. |
| **Thinking Block Preservation** | Not preserved across turns | Not preserved across turns | **Preserved by default** | **Preserved by default** | **Preserved by default** | **Preserved by default** | **Preserved by default.** Blocks are stripped when continuing the conversation on a model that does not support the Mythos thinking format. |

### Thinking block preservation by model

Whether thinking blocks from previous assistant turns are preserved in context by default depends on the model class. **Opus**: Claude Opus 4.5 and later Opus models keep all prior thinking blocks; Claude Opus 4.1 and earlier Opus models keep only the last assistant turn's thinking. **Sonnet**: Claude Sonnet 4.6 and later Sonnet models keep all; Claude Sonnet 4.5 and earlier Sonnet models keep only the last turn. **Haiku**: all Haiku models through Claude Haiku 4.5 keep only the last turn. [Claude Mythos Preview](https://anthropic.com/glasswing) also keeps all prior thinking blocks.

**Benefits of thinking block preservation:**

- **Cache optimization**: When using tool use, preserved thinking blocks enable cache hits as they are passed back with tool results and cached incrementally across the assistant turn, resulting in token savings in multi-step workflows
- **No intelligence impact**: Preserving thinking blocks has no negative effect on model performance

**Important considerations:**

- **Context usage**: Long conversations will consume more context space since thinking blocks are retained in context
- **Automatic behavior**: This is the default for each model as listed above. No code changes or beta headers are required
- **Backward compatibility**: To leverage this feature, continue passing complete, unmodified thinking blocks back to the API as you would for tool use

<Note>
For earlier models (Claude Sonnet 4.5, Opus 4.1, etc.), thinking blocks from previous turns continue to be removed from context. The existing behavior described in the [Extended thinking with prompt caching](#extended-thinking-with-prompt-caching) section applies to those models.
</Note>

## Pricing

For complete pricing information including base rates, cache writes, cache hits, and output tokens, see the [pricing page](/docs/en/about-claude/pricing).

The thinking process incurs charges for:
- Tokens used during thinking (output tokens)
- Thinking blocks from prior assistant turns kept in context: only the last turn on earlier Opus/Sonnet models and all Haiku models; all turns by default on Opus 4.5+ and Sonnet 4.6+ (input tokens)
- Standard text output tokens

<Note>
When extended thinking is enabled, a specialized system prompt is automatically included to support this feature.
</Note>

When using summarized thinking:
- **Input tokens:** Tokens in your original request (excludes thinking tokens from previous turns)
- **Output tokens (billed):** The original thinking tokens that Claude generated internally
- **Output tokens (visible):** The summarized thinking tokens you see in the response
- **No charge:** Tokens used to generate the summary

When using `display: "omitted"`:
- **Input tokens:** Tokens in your original request (same as summarized)
- **Output tokens (billed):** The original thinking tokens that Claude generated internally (same as summarized)
- **Output tokens (visible):** Zero thinking tokens (the `thinking` field is empty)

<Warning>
The billed output token count will **not** match the visible token count in the response. You are billed for the full thinking process, not the thinking content visible in the response.
</Warning>

## Best practices and considerations for extended thinking

### Working with thinking budgets

- **Budget optimization:** The minimum budget is 1,024 tokens. Start at the minimum and increase the thinking budget incrementally to find the optimal range for your use case. Higher token counts enable more comprehensive reasoning but with diminishing returns depending on the task. Increasing the budget can improve response quality at the tradeoff of increased latency. For critical tasks, test different settings to find the optimal balance. Note that the thinking budget is a target rather than a strict limit. Actual token usage may vary based on the task.
- **Starting points:** Start with larger thinking budgets (16k+ tokens) for complex tasks and adjust based on your needs.
- **Large budgets:** For thinking budgets above 32k, use [batch processing](/docs/en/build-with-claude/batch-processing) to avoid networking issues. Requests pushing the model to think above 32k tokens causes long running requests that might run up against system timeouts and open connection limits.
- **Token usage tracking:** Monitor thinking token usage to optimize costs and performance.

### Performance considerations

- **Response times:** Be prepared for longer response times due to additional processing. Generating thinking blocks increases overall response time.
- **Streaming requirements:** The SDKs require streaming when `max_tokens` is greater than 21,333 to avoid HTTP timeouts on long-running requests. This is a client-side validation, not an API restriction. If you don't need to process events incrementally, use `.stream()` with `.get_final_message()` (Python) or `.finalMessage()` (TypeScript) to get the complete `Message` object without handling individual events. See [Streaming Messages](/docs/en/build-with-claude/streaming#get-the-final-message-without-handling-events) for details. When streaming, be prepared to handle both thinking and text content blocks as they arrive.
- **Omitting thinking for latency:** If your application doesn't display thinking content, set `display: "omitted"` on the thinking configuration to reduce time-to-first-text-token. See [Controlling thinking display](#controlling-thinking-display).

### Feature compatibility

- Thinking isn't compatible with `temperature` or `top_k` modifications as well as [forced tool use](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/define-tools#forcing-tool-use).
- When thinking is enabled, you can set `top_p` to values between 1 and 0.95.
- You can't pre-fill responses when thinking is enabled.
- Changes to the thinking budget invalidate cached prompt prefixes that include messages. However, cached system prompts and tool definitions will continue to work when thinking parameters change.

### Usage guidelines

- **Task selection:** Use extended thinking for particularly complex tasks that benefit from step-by-step reasoning, like math, coding, and analysis.
- **Context handling:** You don't need to remove previous thinking blocks yourself. On Opus 4.5+ and Sonnet 4.6+, the Claude API keeps thinking blocks from previous turns by default; on earlier Opus/Sonnet models and all Haiku models, it automatically ignores them and they aren't included when calculating context usage.
- **Prompt engineering:** Review the [extended thinking prompting tips](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-prompting-best-practices#leverage-thinking-and-interleaved-thinking-capabilities) if you want to maximize Claude's thinking capabilities.
