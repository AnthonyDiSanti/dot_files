# Hooks

Hooks are an extensibility framework for Codex. They allow
you to inject your own scripts into the agentic loop, enabling features such as:

- Send the conversation to a custom logging/analytics engine
- Scan your team's prompts to block accidentally pasting API keys
- Summarize conversations to create persistent memories automatically
- Run a custom validation check when a conversation turn stops, enforcing standards
- Customize prompting when in a certain directory

Hooks are behind a feature flag in `config.toml`:

```toml
[features]
codex_hooks = true
```

Runtime behavior to keep in mind:

- Matching hooks from multiple files all run.
- Multiple matching command hooks for the same event are launched concurrently,
  so one hook cannot prevent another matching hook from starting.
- `PreToolUse`, `PermissionRequest`, `PostToolUse`, `UserPromptSubmit`, and
  `Stop` run at turn scope.

## Where Codex looks for hooks

Codex discovers hooks next to active config layers in either of these forms:

- `hooks.json`
- inline `[hooks]` tables inside `config.toml`

Installed plugins can also bundle lifecycle config through their plugin
manifest or a default `hooks/hooks.json` file. See [Build
plugins](https://developers.openai.com/codex/plugins/build#bundled-mcp-servers-and-lifecycle-config) for the
plugin packaging rules.

In practice, the four most useful locations are:

- `~/.codex/hooks.json`
- `~/.codex/config.toml`
- `<repo>/.codex/hooks.json`
- `<repo>/.codex/config.toml`

If more than one hook source exists, Codex loads all matching hooks.
Higher-precedence config layers do not replace lower-precedence hooks.
If a single layer contains both `hooks.json` and inline `[hooks]`, Codex
merges them and warns at startup. Prefer one representation per layer.

Project-local hooks load only when the project `.codex/` layer is trusted. In
untrusted projects, Codex still loads user and system hooks from their own
active config layers.

## Config shape

Hooks are organized in three levels:

- A hook event such as `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, or `Stop`
- A matcher group that decides when that event matches
- One or more hook handlers that run when the matcher group matches

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "matcher": "startup|resume",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 ~/.codex/hooks/session_start.py",
            "statusMessage": "Loading session notes"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/usr/bin/python3 \"$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.codex/hooks/pre_tool_use_policy.py\"",
            "statusMessage": "Checking Bash command"
          }

      }
    ],
    "PermissionRequest": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/usr/bin/python3 \"$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.codex/hooks/permission_request.py\"",
            "statusMessage": "Checking approval request"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/usr/bin/python3 \"$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.codex/hooks/post_tool_use_review.py\"",
            "statusMessage": "Reviewing Bash output"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/usr/bin/python3 \"$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.codex/hooks/user_prompt_submit_data_flywheel.py\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/usr/bin/python3 \"$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.codex/hooks/stop_continue.py\"",
            "timeout": 30
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Notes:

- `timeout` is in seconds.
- If `timeout` is omitted, Codex uses `600` seconds.
- `statusMessage` is optional.
- Commands run with the session `cwd` as their working directory.
- For repo-local hooks, prefer resolving from the git root instead of using a
  relative path such as `.codex/hooks/...`. Codex may be started from a
  subdirectory, and a git-root-based path keeps the hook location stable.

Equivalent inline TOML in `config.toml`:

```toml
[features]
codex_hooks = true

[[hooks.PreToolUse]]
matcher = "^Bash$"

[[hooks.PreToolUse.hooks]]
type = "command"
command = '/usr/bin/python3 "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.codex/hooks/pre_tool_use_policy.py"'
timeout = 30
statusMessage = "Checking Bash command"

[[hooks.PostToolUse]]
matcher = "^Bash$"

[[hooks.PostToolUse.hooks]]
type = "command"
command = '/usr/bin/python3 "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.codex/hooks/post_tool_use_review.py"'
timeout = 30
statusMessage = "Reviewing Bash output"
```

## Managed hooks from `requirements.toml`

Enterprise-managed requirements can also define hooks inline under `[hooks]`.
This is useful when admins want to enforce the hook configuration while
delivering the actual scripts through MDM or another device-management system.

```toml
[features]
codex_hooks = true

[hooks]
managed_dir = "/enterprise/hooks"
windows_managed_dir = 'C:\enterprise\hooks'

[[hooks.PreToolUse]]
matcher = "^Bash$"

[[hooks.PreToolUse.hooks]]
type = "command"
command = "python3 /enterprise/hooks/pre_tool_use_policy.py"
timeout = 30
statusMessage = "Checking managed Bash command"
```

Notes for managed hooks:

- `managed_dir` is used on macOS and Linux.
- `windows_managed_dir` is used on Windows.
- Codex does not distribute the scripts in `managed_dir`; your enterprise
  tooling must install and update them separately.
- Managed hook commands should use absolute script paths under the configured
  managed directory.

## Matcher patterns

The `matcher` field is a regex string that filters when hooks fire. Use `"*"`,
`""`, or omit `matcher` entirely to match every occurrence of a supported
event.

Only some current Codex events honor `matcher`:

| Event               | What `matcher` filters | Notes                                                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `PermissionRequest` | tool name              | Support includes `Bash`, `apply_patch`\*, and MCP tool names |
| `PostToolUse`       | tool name              | Support includes `Bash`, `apply_patch`\*, and MCP tool names |
| `PreToolUse`        | tool name              | Support includes `Bash`, `apply_patch`\*, and MCP tool names |
| `SessionStart`      | start source           | Current runtime values are `startup`, `resume`, and `clear`  |
| `UserPromptSubmit`  | not supported          | Any configured `matcher` is ignored for this event           |
| `Stop`              | not supported          | Any configured `matcher` is ignored for this event           |

\*For `apply_patch`, matchers can also use `Edit` or `Write`.

Examples:

- `Bash`
- `^apply_patch$`
- `Edit|Write`
- `mcp__filesystem__read_file`
- `mcp__filesystem__.*`
- `startup|resume|clear`

## Common input fields

Every command hook receives one JSON object on `stdin`.

These are the shared fields you will usually use:

| Field             | Type             | Meaning                                     |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `session_id`      | `string`         | Current session or thread id.               |
| `transcript_path` | `string \| null` | Path to the session transcript file, if any |
| `cwd`             | `string`         | Working directory for the session           |
| `hook_event_name` | `string`         | Current hook event name                     |
| `model`           | `string`         | Active model slug                           |

Turn-scoped hooks list `turn_id` in their event-specific tables.

If you need the full wire format, see [Schemas](#schemas).

## Common output fields

`SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, and `Stop` support these shared JSON
fields:

```json
{
  "continue": true,
  "stopReason": "optional",
  "systemMessage": "optional",
  "suppressOutput": false
}
```

| Field            | Effect                                          |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `continue`       | If `false`, marks that hook run as stopped      |
| `stopReason`     | Recorded as the reason for stopping             |
| `systemMessage`  | Surfaced as a warning in the UI or event stream |
| `suppressOutput` | Parsed today but not yet implemented            |

Exit `0` with no output is treated as success and Codex continues.

`PreToolUse` and `PermissionRequest` support `systemMessage`, but `continue`,
`stopReason`, and `suppressOutput` aren't currently supported for those events.

`PostToolUse` supports `systemMessage`, `continue: false`, and `stopReason`.
`suppressOutput` is parsed but not currently supported for that event.

## Hooks

### SessionStart

`matcher` is applied to `source` for this event.

Fields in addition to [Common input fields](#common-input-fields):

| Field    | Type     | Meaning                                        |
| -------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `source` | `string` | How the session started: `startup` or `resume` |

Plain text on `stdout` is added as extra developer context.

JSON on `stdout` supports [Common output fields](#common-output-fields) and this
hook-specific shape:

```json
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "SessionStart",
    "additionalContext": "Load the workspace conventions before editing."
  }
}
```

That `additionalContext` text is added as extra developer context.

### PreToolUse

`PreToolUse` can intercept Bash, file edits performed through `apply_patch`,
and MCP tool calls. It is still a guardrail rather than a complete enforcement
boundary because Codex can often perform equivalent work through another
supported tool path.

This doesn't intercept all shell calls yet, only the simple ones. The newer
  `unified_exec` mechanism allows richer streaming stdin/stdout handling of
  shell, but interception is incomplete. Similarly, this doesn't intercept
  `WebSearch` or other non-shell, non-MCP tool calls.

`matcher` is applied to `tool_name` and matcher aliases. For file edits through
`apply_patch`, matchers can use `apply_patch`, `Edit`, or `Write`; hook input
still reports `tool_name: "apply_patch"`.

Fields in addition to [Common input fields](#common-input-fields):

| Field         | Type         | Meaning                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `turn_id`     | `string`     | Codex-specific extension. Active Codex turn id                                                            |
| `tool_name`   | `string`     | Canonical hook tool name, such as `Bash`, `apply_patch`, or an MCP name like `mcp__fs__read`              |
| `tool_use_id` | `string`     | Tool-call id for this invocation                                                                          |
| `tool_input`  | `JSON value` | Tool-specific input. `Bash` and `apply_patch` use `tool_input.command` while MCP tools send all the args. |

Plain text on `stdout` is ignored.

JSON on `stdout` can use `systemMessage` and can block a Bash command with this
hook-specific shape:

```json
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
    "permissionDecision": "deny",
    "permissionDecisionReason": "Destructive command blocked by hook."
  }
}
```

Codex also accepts this older block shape:

```json
{
  "decision": "block",
  "reason": "Destructive command blocked by hook."
}
```

You can also use exit code `2` and write the blocking reason to `stderr`.

`permissionDecision: "allow"` and `"ask"`, legacy `decision: "approve"`,
`updatedInput`, `additionalContext`, `continue: false`, `stopReason`, and
`suppressOutput` are parsed but not supported yet, so they fail open.

### PermissionRequest

`PermissionRequest` runs when Codex is about to ask for approval, such as a
shell escalation or managed-network approval. It can allow the request, deny
the request, or decline to decide and let the normal approval prompt continue.
It doesn't run for commands that don't need approval.

`matcher` is applied to `tool_name` and matcher aliases. Current canonical
values include `Bash`, `apply_patch`, and MCP tool names such as
`mcp__server__tool`; `apply_patch` also matches `Edit` and `Write`.

Fields in addition to [Common input fields](#common-input-fields):

| Field                    | Type             | Meaning                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `turn_id`                | `string`         | Codex-specific extension. Active Codex turn id                                                            |
| `tool_name`              | `string`         | Canonical hook tool name, such as `Bash`, `apply_patch`, or an MCP name like `mcp__fs__read`              |
| `tool_input`             | `JSON value`     | Tool-specific input. `Bash` and `apply_patch` use `tool_input.command` while MCP tools send all the args. |
| `tool_input.description` | `string \| null` | Human-readable approval reason, when Codex has one                                                        |

Plain text on `stdout` is ignored.

To approve the request, return:

```json
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "PermissionRequest",
    "decision": {
      "behavior": "allow"
    }
  }
}
```

To deny the request, return:

```json
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "PermissionRequest",
    "decision": {
      "behavior": "deny",
      "message": "Blocked by repository policy."
    }
  }
}
```

If multiple matching hooks return decisions, any `deny` wins. Otherwise, an
`allow` lets the request proceed without surfacing the approval prompt. If no
matching hook decides, Codex uses the normal approval flow.

Don't return `updatedInput`, `updatedPermissions`, or `interrupt` for
`PermissionRequest`; those fields are reserved for future behavior and fail
closed today.

### PostToolUse

`PostToolUse` runs after supported tools produce output, including Bash,
`apply_patch`, and MCP tool calls. For Bash, it also runs after commands that
exit with a non-zero status. It can't undo side effects from the tool that
already ran.

This doesn't intercept all shell calls yet, only the simple ones. The newer
  `unified_exec` mechanism allows richer streaming stdin/stdout handling of
  shell, but interception is incomplete. Similarly, this doesn't intercept
  `WebSearch` or other non-shell, non-MCP tool calls.

`matcher` is applied to `tool_name` and matcher aliases. For file edits through
`apply_patch`, matchers can use `apply_patch`, `Edit`, or `Write`; hook input
still reports `tool_name: "apply_patch"`.

Fields in addition to [Common input fields](#common-input-fields):

| Field           | Type         | Meaning                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `turn_id`       | `string`     | Codex-specific extension. Active Codex turn id                                                            |
| `tool_name`     | `string`     | Canonical hook tool name, such as `Bash`, `apply_patch`, or an MCP name like `mcp__fs__read`              |
| `tool_use_id`   | `string`     | Tool-call id for this invocation                                                                          |
| `tool_input`    | `JSON value` | Tool-specific input. `Bash` and `apply_patch` use `tool_input.command` while MCP tools send all the args. |
| `tool_response` | `JSON value` | Tool-specific output. For MCP tools, this is the MCP call result.                                         |

Plain text on `stdout` is ignored.

JSON on `stdout` can use `systemMessage` and this hook-specific shape:

```json
{
  "decision": "block",
  "reason": "The Bash output needs review before continuing.",
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "PostToolUse",
    "additionalContext": "The command updated generated files."
  }
}
```

That `additionalContext` text is added as extra developer context.

For this event, `decision: "block"` doesn't undo the completed Bash command.
Instead, Codex records the feedback, replaces the tool result with that
feedback, and continues the model from the hook-provided message.

You can also use exit code `2` and write the feedback reason to `stderr`.

To stop normal processing of the original tool result after the command has
already run, return `continue: false`. Codex will replace the tool result with
your feedback or stop text and continue from there.

`updatedMCPToolOutput` and `suppressOutput` are parsed but not supported yet,
so they fail open.

### UserPromptSubmit

`matcher` isn't currently used for this event.

Fields in addition to [Common input fields](#common-input-fields):

| Field     | Type     | Meaning                                        |
| --------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `turn_id` | `string` | Codex-specific extension. Active Codex turn id |
| `prompt`  | `string` | User prompt that's about to be sent            |

Plain text on `stdout` is added as extra developer context.

JSON on `stdout` supports [Common output fields](#common-output-fields) and
this hook-specific shape:

```json
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "UserPromptSubmit",
    "additionalContext": "Ask for a clearer reproduction before editing files."
  }
}
```

That `additionalContext` text is added as extra developer context.

To block the prompt, return:

```json
{
  "decision": "block",
  "reason": "Ask for confirmation before doing that."
}
```

You can also use exit code `2` and write the blocking reason to `stderr`.

### Stop

`matcher` isn't currently used for this event.

Fields in addition to [Common input fields](#common-input-fields):

| Field                    | Type             | Meaning                                           |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `turn_id`                | `string`         | Codex-specific extension. Active Codex turn id    |
| `stop_hook_active`       | `boolean`        | Whether this turn was already continued by `Stop` |
| `last_assistant_message` | `string \| null` | Latest assistant message text, if available       |

`Stop` expects JSON on `stdout` when it exits `0`. Plain text output is invalid
for this event.

JSON on `stdout` supports [Common output fields](#common-output-fields). To keep
Codex going, return:

```json
{
  "decision": "block",
  "reason": "Run one more pass over the failing tests."
}
```

You can also use exit code `2` and write the continuation reason to `stderr`.

For this event, `decision: "block"` doesn't reject the turn. Instead, it tells
Codex to continue and automatically creates a new continuation prompt that acts
as a new user prompt, using your `reason` as that prompt text.

If any matching `Stop` hook returns `continue: false`, that takes precedence
over continuation decisions from other matching `Stop` hooks.
